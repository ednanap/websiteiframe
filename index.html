        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Edna Napoli, and I am currently pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science with a Minor in Math at Swarthmore College. I have always been passionate about numbers and solving puzzles!  This early passion has naturally led to my current journey in computer science and creating algorithms.

            Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I've honed my problem-solving skills and developed a robust technical toolkit. At Blen, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to design and implement scalable AI solutions, while at ABEM Industries, I led the development of a website that boosted user engagement by 30%. These roles allowed me to leverage my proficiency in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and GraphQL to create impactful web applications.
            
            I'm currently working on a dynamic portfolio website using Three.js, WebGL, and JavaScript, which showcases my proficiency in 3D graphics and web developmentMy background also includes developing algorithms in C++.I'm excited to bring my analytical mindset, technical expertise, and passion for problem-solving to new challenges and opportunities.</p>
